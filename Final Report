Final Report

Introduction
This project aims to predict future stock prices using linear regression. 

Methodology
•	Data Collection: Historical stock prices and trading volume data were collected from kaggle.
•	Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, and created lag features.
•	Model Training: Trained a linear regression model with the processed data.
•	Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using MSE and R square.

Results
The linear regression model achieved an MSE (Mean Squared Error) of X and an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of Y on the test dataset. 
Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a basic approach to stock price prediction. Future work includes integrating additional features and exploring more advanced models.

Future Work
•	Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest).
•	Incorporate external factors such as economic indicators and news sentiment.
